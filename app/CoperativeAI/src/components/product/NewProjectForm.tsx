/** Starting a developer's own project from Develop.

 *  **A Product at the developer stage** — the same record, so Solutions, rules
 *  and work items attach to it exactly as they do to any other and it can grow
 *  as large as a Product. It stays out of the Product tab until the developer
 *  hands it over (one way), from the Develop bar. It exists because the
 *  Developer role cannot open the Product tab, and every Solution needs a
 *  Product: without this, a developer on their own could not start anything.
 *
 *  **Name only.** The Product brief's questions are Product's to answer, and the
 *  framework-file scaffold stays with the Product tab's form.
 *
 *  **AI stays off.** Policy is deny-by-default and set in Admin; the form says
 *  so rather than leaving a developer to find out from a refusal. */
