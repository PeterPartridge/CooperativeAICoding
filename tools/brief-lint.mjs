// Checks item briefs against the Project Brief they belong to.
//
// **One rule today, and it is the one with teeth.** An item names the
// `deliverable` it works towards, and `/build` stops when the last item naming
// a deliverable is built — that pause is the whole reason the field exists. A
// misspelled name breaks it silently and in the worst direction: the item looks
// aimed at something, and the deliverable it was supposed to complete never
// completes, because the last item was never counted. Nothing else in the
// framework would notice, so this does.
//
// **Quiet where there is nothing to check.** A blank brief, or a project whose
// brief names no deliverables yet, is not a fault — it is work not started. A
// tool that reports those as problems is a tool people stop running, so a
// project with no deliverables answered gets **one** line saying how many
// briefs went unchecked, not one line per brief.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/brief-lint.mjs                 # every project in the repository
//   node tools/brief-lint.mjs <projectRoot…>  # just these
//
// Exit code 1 on an error. Warnings are printed and do not fail the run.
